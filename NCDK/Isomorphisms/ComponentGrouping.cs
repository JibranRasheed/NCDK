     * A predicate for verifying component level grouping in query/target structure

     * match to separate components in the target. The grouping specification is
     * indicated by an {@code int[]} array of length (|V(query)| + 1). The final
     * index indicates the maximum component group (in the query). A specification
     * of '0' indicates there are no grouping restrictions.
