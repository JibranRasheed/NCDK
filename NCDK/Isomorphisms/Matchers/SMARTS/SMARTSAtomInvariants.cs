     * Computes and stores atom invariants in a single object. The atom invariants

     * IAtom} API and avoids storing multiple properties in a type unsafe map
     * (<see cref="IAtom.SetProperty(Object, Object)"/>). <p/> Depending on the SMARTS
     * implementation different values for the ring information may be set. The
     * choice of ring set affects {@link #RingNumber} and {@link #RingSize}.
     * Some implementations store all ring sizes whilst others (Daylight) store only
     * the smallest. The {@link #Degree} also depends on whether hydrogens are
     * suppressed or represented as explicit atoms. <p/> The {@link
     * #ConfigureDaylightWithRingInfo(IAtomContainer)} and {@link
     * #ConfigureDaylightWithoutRingInfo(IAtomContainer)} static utilities create
     * and set the invariants following the Daylight implementation. The invariants
     * are set on the {@link #Key} property of each atom.
